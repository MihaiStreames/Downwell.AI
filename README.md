- Make the AI learn via gameplay - the main goal is to reach the bottom
- Define what the bottom is
- Learn by playing and seeing the screen (it will learn to do image processing on its own)
- Same for powerups/shops
- Remove 1 out of the reward every second to incentivize trying different options
- Remove 10 out of the reward every second if immobile (coordinates haven't changed for more than 1 second)
- Reward multiplied by the number of HP (up to 6 (?))
- Reward also affected in some way by the amount of gems and ongoing combo
- Small reward for killing enemies
